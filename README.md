The project emulates a cloud backed smart lock. The hardware layer contains an arduino wired to a servomotor and some additional buzzers and LEDs. The next layer, a web app, communicates with the arduino via Bluetooth Low Energy. When the user interact with the app UI, he sends a locking request to the arduino, which then actions the servomotor based on the request. The third and final layer is the cloud, where two databases are stored. The first is a user list necessary to store the user's credentials (name + password)Â  and another one is a historical list updated every time a user interacts with the smart lock. Everytime a user sends a request to the lock, a json is sent to the cloud where it gets stored in the histo list.
